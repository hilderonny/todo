# ToDo

Simple ToDo app based on ToDoMVC and PouchDB.

This app is based on and inspired on [this guide](https://pouchdb.com/getting-started.html).
The idea is to have a ToDo app on different devices which share the same entries. These features are planned to be included.

- Installable on mobile devices
- Accessible via browser
- Offline usable
- Syncing of todos when back online

## First step - Website hosting

For the hosting I use the free [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offer. You need to setup a new repository and activate GitHub Pages for it in the settings.
This repository - for example - (https://github.com/hilderonny/todo) is configured to be available at https://hilderonny.github.io/todo.

As soon as you update the GitHub pages settings the content of the index.html file or - if not present - the content of the README.md file is shown at the pages URL.
